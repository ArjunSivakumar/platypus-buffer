	Purpose: The program allocates a buffer that can either have a fixed capacity, additive capacity or a
			 multiplicitve capacity depending on the buffer settings. The buffer will read text from a file 
			 into the buffer and then display the contents from the buffer, character by character.

	Purpose: Create and dynmaically allocate Buffer and character Buffer onto the heap
			 with appropicate capacity, increment factor and operation mode (fixed, additive or multiplicative)
	Author: Arjun Sivakumar
	History/Versions: v1.0 (Feburary 2, 2016)
	Called functions: calloc(), malloc(), free()
	Parameters: short init_capacity, char inc_factor (>= 1 and <=255 for o_mode 'a') or (>= 1 and <= 100 for o_mode 'm'), char o_mode ('f','a' or 'm')
	Algorithm: Function attempts to create and allocate a buffer and a character buffer assuming that all parameters are true and there is no bad values. After the buffer is allocated
			   the function will attempt to set the capacity, the increment factor and the mode of the buffer. If bad values exists the function will free up all the dynamically allocated memory and the function 
			   will return NULL as a result of it failing.

				If the buffer capacity is full, the function will check to see if the buffer's operational mode allows for the buffer to expand it's capacity.
				If the buffer's operational mode is in fixed-mode the function will not expand the capacity of the buffer and the function will return NULL.
				However, if the buffer's operational mode is either additive mode or multiplicative mode then buffer will attempt to resize the capacity. If the
				calculation of the new capacity is sucessfull then the function will reallocate the buffer with the newly calculated capacity.
